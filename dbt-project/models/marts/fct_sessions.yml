  - name: fct_sessions
    description: >
      Session fact table that applies a 1-hour inactivity timeout to split
      sessions spanning unreasonably long periods. 2.16% of sessions in the raw data
      span up to 6 months due to session IDs being reused without an inactivity timeout.
      This model detects gaps >3600 seconds between consecutive events within a session
      and assigns new session IDs at each timeout boundary.
    columns:
      - name: session_id
        description: >
          Cleaned session identifier. Original session ID if no timeout occurred,
          or original_id + '_timeout_' + occurrence_number for split sessions.
