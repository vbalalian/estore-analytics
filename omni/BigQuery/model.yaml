  This model covers e-commerce analytics for a multi-category online retailer,
  built on 400M+ user events (views, cart adds, purchases) ranging from Oct 1 
  2019 to Apr 30 2020. Three topics are available: Sessions (conversion funnel 
  analysis, session quality, engagement patterns), Customers (lifecycle 
  segmentation, RFM scoring, churn, LTV), and Events (granular event-level 
  analysis by product, category, brand, and customer segment). Use Sessions 
  for funnel and conversion questions, Customers for user-level segmentation 
  and retention questions, and Events for product performance and event-level 
  breakdowns.
